# MO-PCDE_M9_final_assignment

## Required Final Assignment 9.1 (Part 1): GitHub and Advanced Python Functions  
**Author:** Amani KONAN

---

## Module Summary

In this module, I explored advanced Python concepts including:

- **Python Classes**: Creating classes, adding attributes, using constructors, and class-level vs instance-level data.
- **Dynamic Attribute Management**: Using `setattr` and `__module__` attributes.
- **Functions with Variable Arguments**: Utilizing `*args` and `**kwargs` to build flexible functions.
- **Decorators and Wrappers**: Enhancing functions using decorators with and without arguments, and nesting logic through wrapper functions.

These concepts were applied in a series of increasingly complex tasks, culminating in this final assignment.
